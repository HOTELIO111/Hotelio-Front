                instead as these will govern the relation between you and that

                provided by a Partner, your booking through the Platform is an
                offer to book a reservation (e.g., for Accommodations, or
                Flights you are making a request to book a reservation with the
                Partner that is subject to acceptance by the Partner before it
                becomes a binding transaction) at the price listed on the
                Platform for such Travel Product on such other terms and
                conditions notified to you by the Partner at the time of
                booking, which shall become a binding contract when your booking
                is accepted by the Partner and will be subject to the Partner’s
                terms and conditions. Where applicable, the Partner will
                indicate the acceptance of such Travel Product booking via an
                e-mail confirmation to you. In these cases, we will provide your
                payment information to the relevant Partner to process your
                payment and confirm your booking. The Partner reserves the right
                to reject bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.

                the booking process. As the Travel Supplier Terms applicable for

                understand and accept all of the applicable Travel Supplier
                Terms before completing your booking. If you are booking on

                    Suppliers, as vendors, include all known applicable taxes in
                    the amount displayed as the total price of your booking and
                    Hotelio pays over such amounts on your behalf directly to

                    the vendors with whom we book or reserve our customer's
                    travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate
                    and the type of applicable taxes may vary depending on
                    various factors such as location, type of service etc.

                certain Flight segments will be confirmed and other Flight
                segments for the same journey cannot be booked (or may be
                cancelled or significantly changed after booking). You
                acknowledge that each Flight segment in a combined journey is a
                separate flight booking. You will not be allowed to modify or
                cancel the confirmed Flight segments for free, even if other
                Flight segments for the same journey are not successfully
                booked. All Flight bookings are subject to terms and conditions

                policies on Flight booking changes and fees, cancellations, and

                segments, which may need to be changed individually. This may
                result in separate fees and charges to change each segment,
                including the HOTELIO Booking Fees. You may require evidence of
                a return or onward travel for international flights. If the

                receive a single booking confirmation for the whole journey. The
                fee HOTELIO retains as part of the compensation for its Services
                and to cover the costs of booking or facilitating your

                reservation modification, scheduled times and dates, liability,
                and fare restrictions and conditions. There may also be

                tickets and other bookings which include segments which you do

                on buying a return ticket when you only intend to travel

                result in cancellation of your Flight(s), being denied access to

                We may also charge you for any costs and penalties incurred as a

                carefully prior to making your booking, including where the

                or any other Travel Product until you change your Price Alert
                settings. Opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any
