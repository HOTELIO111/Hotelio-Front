            Many data processing operations are only possible with website
            visitor’s/user’s express consent. You can revoke your consent at any
            time by e-mail. The legality of the data processing carried out

            <b>Right of Appeal To The Responsible Supervisory Authority</b>
          </p>

            In the event of violations of data protection law, the person
            concerned has the right to file a complaint with the competent
            supervisory authority. The responsible supervisory authority for

            <b>REncryption</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the confidential content, such
            as orders or inquiries that you send to us, our website uses
            encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact
            that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to
            “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If the
            encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be
            read by third parties.

          <p>
            <b>Encrypted Payment Transactions on This Website</b>

            If there is an obligation to provide us with your payment data (e.g.
            account number for direct debit authorization) after the conclusion
            of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment
            processing. Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa
            / MasterCard, direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted
            SSL or TLS connection. With encrypted communication, your payment
            data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

            automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored
            on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to
            recognize your browser/device the next time you visit. You can set
            your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies
            and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance

            (e.g. shopping cart function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6
            Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate
            interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and
            optimized provision of its services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g.
            cookies for analyzing your surfing behavior) are stored, they will

          <p>
            The website provider automatically collects and stores information
            in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically
            transmits to us. These are:

            <li>IP address</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data will not be merged with other data sources. The basis for
            data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the
            processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or
            pre-contractual measures.
          </p>
          <h5>Contact Form</h5>
          <p>
            If you send us inquiries using the contact form, your details from
            the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there,
            will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and
            in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without
            your consent. The processing of the data entered in the contact form
            takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1
            lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal
            e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing
            operations carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by
            the revocation. The data you enter in the contact form will remain
            with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to
            storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g.
            after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions -
            in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.
          </p>
          <h5>Registration on This Website</h5>
          <p>
            You can register on our website in order to use additional functions
            on the site. We use the data entered for this purpose only for the
            purpose of using the respective offer or service for which you have
            registered. The mandatory information requested during registration
            must be given in full. Otherwise we will reject the registration.
            For important changes, for example in the scope of the offer or for
            technically necessary changes, we will use the e-mail address
            provided during registration to inform you in this way. The
            processing of the data entered during registration is based on your
            consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at
            any time. An informal e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of
            the data processing that has already taken place remains unaffected
            by the revocation. The data recorded during registration will be
            stored by us as long as you are registered on our website and will
            then be deleted. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.
          </p>
          <h5>Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)</h5>
          <p>
            We collect, process and use personal data only insofar as they are
            necessary for the establishment, content or change of the legal
            relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Article
            6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a
            contract or pre-contractual measures. We collect, process and use
            personal data on the use of our website (usage data) only insofar as
            this is necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill.
            The customer data collected will be deleted after the order has been
            completed or the business relationship has ended. Statutory
            retention periods remain unaffected.

            We only transfer personal data to third parties if this is necessary

            entrusted with the hotel facilities management or the credit
            institution commissioned with the processing of related payments. A
            further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you

            third parties beyond this. Your data will be deleted automatically
            three months after the related process has been fully completed.
            This does not apply if statutory provisions prevent deletion,
            further storage is necessary for the purpose of providing evidence
            or you have expressly consented to longer storage.
